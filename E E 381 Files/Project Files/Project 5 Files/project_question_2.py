"""
Create a function that generates a one-bit message(in the form of "0" or "1").
Set constants p_0 = 0.35, e_0 = 0.04, or e_1 = 0.05.
The transmitting signal is represented by "S" and the receiving signal is represented by "R".
Output S = 0 when m = np.random.rand() < p_0 and S = 1 when m = np.random.rand() > p_0.
Generate R = 0 when S = 0 and t = np.random.rand() > e_0 or when S = 1 and t = np.random.rand() <= e_1.
Generate R = 1 when S = 0 and t = np.random.rand() <= e_0 or when S = 1 and t = np.random.rand() > e_1.
Now compare the results of S and R. If R = 1 when S = 1, then the experiment is a "success".
Repeat the experiment for 100_000 times and note the number of successes.
Finally, calculate the probability of success by dividing the number of successes by 100_000.
